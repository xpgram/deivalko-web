    "description": "An in-browser clone of \"Advance Wars: Days of Ruin\" (2008).\nThe primary gameplay is somewhere around 70% complete. The map and tileset system is capable of handling nearly any configuration. Almost all troop-types and actions are fully implemented, with accompanying animations. And the troop-instruction system is primed and ready for AI and online player opponents (when I implement them)."

If you intend to view it, please allow Heroku time to spin up the servers; I haven't paid for hosting.\nThe site was built to demonstrate website design and construction as well as third party API integration."

If you tell it when your bills are, it'll tell you when they're due forever.\nIt's an estimation tool, it doesn't integrate with anything. But it is quite useful when trying to figure out how much money you should theoretically have 6 months from now."
