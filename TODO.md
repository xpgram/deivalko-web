- [ ] Change glow around nav buttons to be more radial, and have that radial extend from the right edge.
- [ ] Pink section-line is set to 95vh, make that some maximum. Really tall windows don't need the extra platform.
- [ ] Change logos to svg's?
  They're both two-tone, so this would be some work, but then they'd be scalable.
  Can I apply the glitch effect to an svg, though?
  Can PixiJs accept svg's, rather.

- [ ] Motion parallax?
  Not specifically sure what for yet, but rellax.js is an option.
